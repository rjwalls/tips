### Shared Folders

I can never remember how to get shared folders working correctly in Dropbox. With this snippet, now I don't have to.

```bash
#Step 0: step up the shared folder in the virtualbox settings.
# Make sure to select "automount". This will place mount the folder at /media/sf_SHARE_NAME
#Step 1: add yourself to the vboxsf group
sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf rjwalls
```

Everything should work as expected now.

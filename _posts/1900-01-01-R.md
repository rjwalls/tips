R is a wonderfully confusing language. Fortunately, people like [Hadley
Wickham][hadley] are here to help. Therefore, most of these commands will be
in the context of packages like [dplyr][dpl] and [ggplot][ggp].

#### Dataframes

Use `df %>% group_by(X) %>% tally` for a nice quick summary of a dataframe.


#### Working With Files

Write delimited file without quotes, row, and column labels:

```r
df %>% write.table('gtlds.txt', row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

#### RStudio

Shortcut for the dplyr operator (`%>%`): `Cmd+shft+m`.

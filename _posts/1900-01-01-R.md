R is a wonderfully confusing language. Fortunately, people like [Hadley
Wickham][hadley] are here to help. Therefore, most of these commands will be
in the context of packages like [dplyr][dpl] and [ggplot][ggp].

If you are in need of some more general plotting advice, take a look at the [Compendium of Clean Graphs in R][comp]

#### Working with Strings

Sometimes you want to create a cartesian product of multiple lists of strings. Well friend, [Sven Hohenstein][cart]
has got you covered. In short, add the following function to your code:

```R
combine2 <- function(..., prefix="", sep="") {
  paste0(prefix, levels(interaction(..., sep=sep)))
}
```

Examples:

```R
a <- c('a', 'b')
b <- c('1', '2', '3')
c <- c('??', '!!)

combine2(a, b)
#[1] "a1" "b1" "a2" "b2" "a3" "b3"

combine2(a, b, c)
#[1] "a1!!" "b1!!" "a2!!" "b2!!" "a3!!" "b3!!" "a1??" "b1??" "a2??" "b2??" "a3??" "b3??"
```

#### Dataframes

Use `df %>% group_by(X) %>% tally` for a nice quick summary of a dataframe.

Get number of rows in the dataframe: `nrow(df)`.

#### Working With Files

Write delimited file without quotes, row, and column labels:

```r
df %>% write.table('gtlds.txt', row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

Read a csv using the [readr][readr] package: `df <- read_csv('test.csv')`.

#### RStudio

Shortcut for the dplyr operator (`%>%`): `Cmd+shft+m`.

#### ggplot

Force commas in axis labels:
```r
library(scales)

ggplot(df, aes(x=foo)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=comma)
```

#### Quantiles

`quantile(df$foo, probs=seq(0,1,0.25))`

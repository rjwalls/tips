R is a wonderfully confusing language. Fortunately, people like [Hadley
Wickham][hadley] are here to help. Therefore, most of these commands will be
in the context of packages like [dplyr][dpl] and [ggplot][ggp].

#### Dataframes

Use `df %>% group_by(X) %>% tally` for a nice quick summary of a dataframe.

Get number of rows in the dataframe: `nrow(df)`.

#### Working With Files

Write delimited file without quotes, row, and column labels:

```r
df %>% write.table('gtlds.txt', row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

Read a csv using the [readr][readr] package: `df <- read_csv('test.csv')`.

#### RStudio

Shortcut for the dplyr operator (`%>%`): `Cmd+shft+m`.

#### ggplot

Force commas in axis labels:
```r
library(scales)

ggplot(df, aes(x=foo)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=comma)
```

#### Quantiles

`quantile(df$foo, probs=seq(0,1,0.25))`

### Style Information

Check out Raymond Hettinger's tips on [writing beautiful python](https://gist.github.com/JeffPaine/6213790).

### Working with files

Use `os.path.realpath()` to elegantly handle command line arguments that might be relative paths.  

`glob.glob('*.txt')` will return a list of text files in the working directory.

Get the filename with `os.path.basename()`.


### CLI Template

A simple template for creating CLI python applications---can read from input stdin or a given input file.

```python
import argparse
import logging
import sys


def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('infile', nargs='?', type=argparse.FileType('r'), default=sys.stdin)
    parser.add_argument('-v', '--verbose', action='store_const', const=logging.INFO, dest='loglevel',
                        help='increase output verbosity.')
    parser.add_argument('-d', '--debug', action='store_const', const=logging.DEBUG, dest='loglevel',
                        default=logging.WARNING, help='show debug output (even more than -v).')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()

    logging.basicConfig(level=args.loglevel)

    for line in args.infile:
        pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Regular Expressions

```python
import re

# Matches seconds, hours, minutes, e.g., 10, 10s, 1m, 1h
value, unit = re.match(r'(?P<value>[0-9]+)(?P<unit>[smh]?)', raw.lower()).groups()
```


### Virtual Environments

Sometimes you just get sick of trying to resolve all of the strange dependencies in order to make that shiny new
python package work (Ed. Note: I am looking at you scrapy)---Virtual Environments to the rescue.

Go to your project directory and do the following:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

#you should see 'venv' at the beginning of your command prompt now
pip install Scrapy

#test that it worked
which scrapy

#Save the requirements in case you want to remake
pip freeze > requirements.txt

#Get rid of it
deactivate
rm -rf venv

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Read more about Virtual Environments [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

### Errors!

**ImportError**. Occasionally (if your primary machine account isn't an admin), 
you'll get the dreaded `ImportError: No module named...` when trying to import a package, even
though `pip install` tells you everything is fine. You are probably getting this error because you previously thought it
was necessary to use `sudo` to install the package. To fix this, uninstall the package using `sudo` and reinstall
without `sudo` using the `--user` option. For example:

```bash
su admin
sudo pip uninstall beautifulsoup4

#Switch back to a normal user (one without sudo powers)
pip install --user beautifulsoup4
```

Make sure that you have also added the appropriate package-binary path to your PATH variable as some package need this, e.g., scrapy.

```bash
#Find scrapy
find ~ -name scrapy

#Add that path to your PATH variable (you can also put this in your bash_profile)
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin
```

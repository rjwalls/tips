Need to remove large files from your repo history? Check out [bfg](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/#download).

Checkout a particular commit-version of a file.

```bash
git checkout ASDFHDFS file.txt
```

Check the size of the repo.

```bash
git bundle create tmp.bundle --all
du -sh tmp.bundle
```

Get around the "Invalid certificate chain" error.

```bash
git config --global http.sslVerify false
```

Get the differences in the working version of a file.

```bash
git diff HEAD~1 file.tex
```

List the tracked files in the current directory.

```bash
git ls-files
```

Globally ignore all files named `*.swp`.

```bash
echo *.swp >> ~/.cvsignore
git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.cvsignore'
```

Remove `*.swp` files from a repository---assuming they are being tracked
already.

```bash
git rm -cached *.swp 
```

Remove `*.swp` files from both current directory and repository.

```bash
git rm *.swp
```

Stash your local changes. This is useful when you need to go back to the original
working state.  

```bash
git stash save "the stash info"
```

Amend local commit; useful when you forgot to add some changes in the current
commit.

```bash
# Used git ci -m "my commit" already
git commit -a --amend 
```

Export the repository without the .git information.

```bash
git archive master | tar -x -C /somewhere/else
```

Check out a file from any commit (commits are identified by SHA1 hash of 40
 characters).

```bash
git checkout commit_sha1 filename
```
Drop all the local changes since last commit and push to remote **harsh**.

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

#### Git Svn

**Gotcha:** The svn directory needs to have at least one commit or you will get errors when
you clone.

#### Git and Latex

Generate a diff PDF for the working directory. Make sure you have the [git-latexdiff](https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff) wrapper installed.  

```bash
git latexdiff HEAD~1 --

#Or
git latexdiff HEAD~3 HEAD --main paper/paper.tex --whole-tree -c"PICTUREENV=(?:picture|DIFnomarkup|lstlisting|lstinline)[\w\d*@]*"
```

#### Github Pages

Github pages is an awesome thing, but sometimes you don't actually need a master branch for your project. For example, [the repository][tips] for this site. First thing you need to do is set `gh-pages` to be your default branch on Github. You can do this by going to "Settings>Branches" from the repository page on Github. Once there, just select `gh-pages` using the drop down. 

Now on your local repo do the following:

```bash
git checkout gh-pages
git branch -D master
git push origin :master
```

I got this tip from [here](https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/gh_delete_master.html).

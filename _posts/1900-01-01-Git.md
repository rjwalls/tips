Get the differences in the working version of a file.
```bash
git diff HEAD~1 file.tex
```

List the tracked files in the current directory.

```bash
git ls-files
```

Globally ignore all files named `*.swp`.

```bash
echo *.swp >> ~/.cvsignore
git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.cvsignore'
```

Remove `*.swp` files from a repository---assuming they are being tracked
already.

```bash
git rm -cached *.swp 
```

Remove `*.swp` files from both current directory and repository.

```bash
git rm *.swp
```

Stash your local changes. This is useful when you need to go back to the original
working state.  

```bash
git stash save "the stash info"
```

Amend local commit; useful when you forgot to add some changes in the current
commit.

```bash
# Used git ci -m "my commit" already
git commit -a --amend 
```

Export the repository without the .git information.

```bash
git archive master | tar -x -C /somewhere/else
```

Check out a file from any commit (commits are identified by SHA1 hash of 40
 characters).

```bash
git checkout commit_sha1 filename
```
Drop all the local changes since last commit and push to remote **harsh**.

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

#### Git Svn

**Gotcha:** The svn directory needs to have at least one commit or you will get errors when
you clone.

#### Git and Latex

Generate a diff PDF for the working directory. Make sure you have the [git-latexdiff](https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff) wrapper installed.  

```bash
git latexdiff HEAD~1 --
```

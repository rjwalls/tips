Running a script with multiple arguments using GNU parrallel on UNIX.

```bash
parallel -j 20 --ungroup python myscript.py {1} ::: val1 val2 val3
```

Replace 20 by the number of cores to use

--ungroup is used to display the output of the scripts as they come (not grouped by argument)

{n} indicates the position of arguments

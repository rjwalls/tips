Reload your bash profile: `source ~/.bash_profile`.

Need to remove those odd Windows line endings? `dos2unix` is your friend.

Want to run a script over each file of a certain name in a directory?

```bash
find ../blah-directory -name "*rules.txt" -print0 | 
  xargs -0 -I {} ./myscript.sh {} | tee all_output.tsv
```

#### Get Public IP

```bash
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

Put this in your `bashrc`:

```bash
alias wanip='dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com'
```
